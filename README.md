# Repository for Adversarial Implicit Hashing

This is the repository for the paper * [Efficient Implicit Unsupervised Text Hashing using Adversarial Autoencoder (WWW'20)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366423.3380150). 

## Important Notice

This repository is now consolidated under https://github.com/khoadoan/adversarial-hashing. 

The primal Wasserstein distance estimate (using Optimal Transport) is under the `python/loss/gan_loss.py` module. Please feel free to contact the corresponding author at khoadoan@vt.edu for any additional questions.
